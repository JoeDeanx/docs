## Authentication

The Flux AI Image Generator API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can obtain your API key from your [Flux AI Dashboard](https://fluxaiimagegenerator.com/my/api).

### Using Your API Key

All API requests must include your API key in the request headers. Add the following header to your requests:

```http
X-API-KEY: your-api-key
```

<Note>
  Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. If you believe your API
  key has been compromised, you can generate a new one from your dashboard.
</Note>

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:
https://api-flux.aiturboapi.com
